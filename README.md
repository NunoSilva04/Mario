UPDATED: The project is complete due to the fact that not only i wish to move on to another project but mostly because one of my classes is not in the correct place of the implementation, making my ability to add enemies, powerups and such not difficult but difficult in the terms of interacting with the blocks i had already added. To perform such chnages it would require almost a full refactor of the code, for this reason i am dropping it
